# TimeLapses

Interactively create time lapses from folders with photos.


## Installation

Clone this repo or just copy the `Makefile` to somewhere convenient, e.g.
`~/Videos/TimeLapses`. Also make sure `ffmpeg` and `GNU make` are installed.

## Usage

1. Create a subdirectory per project
1. Copy your photos to that directory
1. Run `make` from the main directory

Then wait for a bit, and enjoy your generated videos.

## More details

Currently the default `ffmpeg` quality settings are used, which work fine for me.
